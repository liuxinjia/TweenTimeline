# Tween TimeLine

---

**TweenTimeline** is a powerful animation design tool for Unity that enables you to visually create, organize, and manage animations with no coding required. The intuitive and familiar **Timeline** window allows you to seamlessly sequence animations, making it easy to build complex transitions and effects.

With **TweenTimeline**, adding and editing animations is both straightforward and fast. The tool supports both **Straight Ahead Action** for smooth, natural motion, and **Pose to Pose** for personalized, keyframe-based animation.

Additionally, **tween collections** and **tween components** enhance asset reuse across projects, promoting a more efficient workflow.

Feel free to use it and contribute to its development!

# ‚ú® Features

## Tween Timeline

---

- **Real-time Preview**: Use buttons to play/stop animations or drag the timeline cursor for real-time scrubbing and feedback.
    - **Individual Clip Preview**: Play single clips in isolation for detailed adjustments.
    - **Individual Track Group Preview**: Play the select group you want to focus
    - **Full Timeline Preview**: See the entire animation sequence to check transitions and overall flow..
- **Control Animation Properties**: Record scene changes to adjust both **visual** and **motion properties**, including timing and animation curves.
    - **Pose-to-Pose (Tween Animation)**: Create smooth animations for simple effects, such as changing an object‚Äôs position or scale. This method allows you to set just two keyframes (start and  end ) with easing functions, resulting in fluid transitions ideal for animations.
    - **Straight Ahead Action (Frame-by-Frame Animation)**: For more complex effects, you can fine-tune multiple parameters by creating frame-by-frame animations. This approach provides detailed control and enables expressive, non-linear movements, making it ideal for handcrafted or intricate actions.
- **Animation Layering**: Organize and layer animations by dragging and adjusting their priority on the timeline.
- **Intelligent Layering**: Automatically group animations by panels or composites. Separate layers for enter and exit animations, and manage layers for the same property on a single object.
- **Useful Track Actions**: Quickly generate exit animations based on the entry position or reset objects to their original state with a single click.

## Tween Action

> Note: For more detailed examples and API documentation, [see the api below](https://www.notion.so/Tween-Timeline-Home-Page-11d7440b69108091a700fc1f238036f9?pvs=21).

**Runtime Components (Sample)**
![image.png](Document/AnimationComponents.gif)
- **Panel Binder**: Handle panel transitions
- **Composite Binder**: Manage composite transitions
- **Animation Components**: Attach to UI elements to respond to various events (e.g., HoverBinder for pointer events)

## Tips & Best Practices

- Keep animation tracks organized in logical groups
- Use markers for chagne state
    - Try Empty Track if there exist no animation. For exmaple, set one image to disable when animation start.
- Test a whole transitions with different thoroughly in one itmeline asset

# **üîç API Reference**

Use the api from GenerateTween directly:

```csharp
GenerateTween.HomePanel_InTween(bindig);
```

Invoke api with string key from GenerateTween:

```csharp
((ITweenBinding)binder).Play("HomePanel_InTween");
```

You need to define some data to be binded. We define an interface to bind like this:

```csharp
    public interface ITweenBinding
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the tween bound object.
        /// </summary>
        /// <typeparam name="T">The type of the bound object.</typeparam>
        /// <param name="name">The name of the bound object.</param>
        /// <returns>Returns the bound object of the specified type.</returns>
        T GetBindObj<T>(string name) where T : class;

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the easing effect.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="easeName">The name of the easing effect.</param>
        /// <returns>Returns the corresponding easing effect.</returns>
        PrimeTween.Easing GetEasing(string easeName);

        /// <summary>
        /// Plays an audio clip.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="audioSource">The audio source.</param>
        /// <param name="clipName">The name of the audio clip.</param>
        /// <param name="clipTime">The starting time to play the clip.</param>
        void PlayAudioClip(AudioSource audioSource, string clipName, float clipTime);

        /// <summary>
        /// Sets the sprite image.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="image">The image component to set.</param>
        /// <param name="sprite">The name of the sprite to set.</param>
        void SetSprite(Image image, string sprite);
    }
```

You can find an example implementation of **ITweenBinding** in the Demo.

# ‚ùì Q&A

1. Why use PrimeTween instead Of Dotween?
    
    PrimeTween has 0 runtime memory allocations
    
2. How does the tool convert animations?
We simplify different keyframes to just two keyframes: the start and end keyframes. The intermediate keyframes are handled by evaluating the animation curve. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that we have the appropriate curve in place.
Below is an example comparing the animation clip with our converted track.
    
    ![image.png](Document/image%201.png)
    
    ![image.png](Document/image%202.png)
    
    **Another issue we encounter: Object KeyFrames.**
    
    We need to convert certain non-animatable properties, specifically unsupported types such as string, bool, and (~~Sprite~~). We are attempting to use markers to handle these cases.
    
    ![image.png](Document/image%203.png)
    
    and we use reflection to get all not animatale Field Types And Properties.
    
    ![image.png](Document/image%204.png)
    
    ![image.png](Document/image%205.png)
    
    ![image.png](Document/image%206.png)
    
    ```csharp
               .Group(Sequence.Create()
                    .InsertCallback(0.3166667f, binding.GetBindObj<UnityEngine.RectTransform>("Bg"), (target) => { target.gameObject.SetActive(false);})
                    .InsertCallback(1.333333f, binding.GetBindObj<UnityEngine.RectTransform>("Bg"), (target) => { target.gameObject.SetActive(true);})
               )
    ```
    
    ```csharp
               .Group(Sequence.Create()
                    .InsertCallback(0.3166667f, binding.GetBindObj<UnityEngine.UI.Image>("NextBtn"), (target) => { binding.SetSprite(target, "clock_blue");})
                    .InsertCallback(0.8166667f, binding.GetBindObj<UnityEngine.UI.Image>("NextBtn"), (target) => { binding.SetSprite(target, "BlueBtn");})
                    .InsertCallback(1.333333f, binding.GetBindObj<UnityEngine.UI.Image>("NextBtn"), (target) => { binding.SetSprite(target, "BlueBtn");})
               )
               .Group(Sequence.Create()
                    .InsertCallback(0.3166667f, binding.GetBindObj<UnityEngine.UI.Image>("backArrow"), (target) => { binding.SetSprite(target, "BackArrow");})
                    .InsertCallback(1.333333f, binding.GetBindObj<UnityEngine.UI.Image>("backArrow"), (target) => { binding.SetSprite(target, "blueprint_rare");})
               )             
    ```
    
    However, there are some issues we cannot resolve or practices to avoid:
    
    ÂÖ≥‰∫éCurve ‰∏ç‰∏ÄËá¥
    
    1. Use alternative methods for looping.
        
        ![image.png](Document/image%207.png)
        
    2. Inconsistencies with the curve:The last frame has a different duration from the clip (usually occurs after deleting the last frame).
    
        
        ![image.png](Document/image%208.png)
        
        ![image.png](Document/image%209.png)
        
    
    1. Why one track can only control one proerty?
        
        Êàë‰ª¨ÂèëÁé∞ÊØè‰∏™track Âè™ÊéßÂà∂‰∏Ä‰∏™Â±ûÊÄßÔºåÂØπ‰∫éÊï¥‰ΩìÊù•ËØ¥Êõ¥Âä†Áõ¥ËßÇÔºå‰∏îÈöèÁùÄÂä®ÁîªÁöÑ‰∏çÊñ≠Â¢ûÂä†Ôºå‰∏çÂêåtrack ‰πãÈó¥‰πüËÉΩËÅåËÉΩÊòéÁ°Æ„ÄÇÂêåÊó∂ÈÄöËøáË∞ÉÁ†îÔºåÊàë‰ª¨ÂèëÁé∞Â§ßÈÉ®ÂàÜÂ∑•ÂÖ∑ÂÆûÁé∞‰πüÊòØÂ¶ÇÊ≠§„ÄÇ
